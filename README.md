# Geometry-of-ternary-tensor-eigenshcemes
We include some Macaulay2 functions to test whether a configuration of points is the eigenscheme of a partially symmetric or of a symmetric tensor. 
See https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12789 for a reference.

The file Eigenschemes.m2 contains the code for 5 functions: isEigenscheme, isEigenschemeSymmetric, isIdealEigenscheme, isIdealEigenschemeSymmetric, reconstructSymmetricTensor.
The function reconstructSymmetricTensor is only an help function.

We now include some examplex to illustrate the usage of the functions above.
